# <Project Study Guide>

## Description

This project was meant to be a device of convenience and efficiency for studying CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and git. I built this to keep track of useful tips as I go on as well as being a sandbox test. This project solves my personal issue of keeping everything organised, and so this keeps all my notes together. Throughout the course of this project, I learned the basics of 4 common programming languages and how to use programming software.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
